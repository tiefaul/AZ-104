## Notes taken for AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator
- This project contains only notes and so far the only notes I have taken are from the training resources given to us from the Microsoft Website

    - I would recommend opening these notes and its resources in VSCode and not viewing on GitHub

I use Joplin for all of my note taking. Very useful application and it can be downloaded from here - (https://joplinapp.org/)
